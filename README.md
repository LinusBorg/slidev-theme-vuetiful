## Layouts

> Note: I'm still in the process of adding more slide variations.

This theme provides the following layouts:

 - Default (improved w/grid)
 - BigPoints
 - Cover
 - Section
 - Quote
 - SFC
 - Video

### Default

### Cover

A Cover slide for the Talk Title & Subtitle

```frontmatter
---
layout: cover
clicks: 1
---

# Vuetiful Theme
A Vue-inspired theme for my talks about Vue
```

> Note: the `clicks: 1` is necessary for the entry transition to work properly
#### Example

### Big Points

This slide type is much like the default slide, the main difference is that the content font-size is bigger and the content in centered.

Useful for slides that just contain a few points or sentences.

### Section

This slide can be used to split your talks into sections. It's meant to only have a single heading.

### Quote

Sometimes you want to drive home a point with a quote. This slide provides a nice way of doing that.

#### Example

### SFC (Single File Component Preview)

This template integrates the SF playground ([sfc.vuejs.org](https://sfc.vuejs.org)) which allows for live demos. It's usage requires a bit of preparation/config.

#### Config

```ts
// ./setup/main.ts
import { defineAppSetup } from '@slidev/types'

// use Vite's raw imports to get file content as string
// (see: https://vitejs.dev/guide/features.html#static-assets)
import Test from '../examples/Test.vue?raw'
import App from '../examples/App.vue?raw'
import Child from '../examples/Child.vue?raw'


interface Examples {
  [key: string]: string |Â {
    [key: string]: string
  }
}
const examples: Examples = {
  // for examples consisting of a single file, 
  // just pass its content as value
  // File will be named App.vue
  Test: Test,
  // to construct an example from multiple files,
  // or have a custom name for the file,
  // pass an object where each key is the filename 
  // and value is the file content string
  Multiple: {
    'App.vue': App,
    'Child.vue': Child,
  }
}

export default defineAppSetup(({ app }) => {
  // use app.provide to make all examples 
  // available to the SFC Slide implementation
  app.provide('sfc-examples', examples)
})
```

### Usage

```frontmatter
---
layout: sfc
example: Test 
---

# This will be the slide's title
```
